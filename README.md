# InsightSphere: Dimensional Modeling of Covid-19 Data

## Executive Summary

The profound impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has transformed daily life, altering work and interaction patterns, while exposing the inherent fragility of the global community. This crisis has highlighted the vulnerabilities of health systems worldwide. The final project focuses on analyzing a comprehensive COVID dataset to demonstrate the application of analytics in strengthening resilience against global shocks like the recent pandemic.

To achieve this, daily country-level data spanning from January 1st, 2020, to November 29th, 2023, was compiled, encompassing 1,429 days of information for all countries worldwide from Our World in Data. After confirming the dataâ€™s suitability for dimensional modeling, an analytical database was established. Following a thorough review of the dataset, three analytical questions were formulated, which are elaborated upon in the subsequent sections.

These figures exemplify the world's collective response to the pandemic.

## Data Acquisition

The data used in this project is sourced from the GitHub repository managed by Our World in Data, encompassing country-level data for every nation globally. The extensive dataset comprises 358,802 observations and 67 variables, categorized into 8 metrics: Vaccinations, Testing and Positivity, Hospital & ICU, Confirmed Cases, Confirmed Deaths, Reproduction Rate, Policy Responses, and other variables of interest. The table below offers a more detailed perspective.
